	++ THE GESTUMBLINDI CHALLENGE ++
Gestumblindi has been busy learning Java. No mean feat for a mythological character. Now he’s throwing down the gauntlet and challenging you to get coding.
He wants you to write an application in the language of your choice. It should take the term “optimizationmatters” and generate a list and count of all possible 3 letter words contained within an English dictionary. If you want to show off your optimization skills how about generating all possible words for length 1 up to 19?
